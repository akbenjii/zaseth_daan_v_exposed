# How CPLegacy's ski turned out to be Zaseth
fuck zaseth fuck r/clubpenguin

On ‚Äî 05/25/2022, there was a group created because of the similarities found between ski and an ex-cprewritten developer, zaseth. An individual who got "demoted" from CPR for his predatorial tendencies, asking community members for nudes, a racist and a whole list of other wrongdoings which Maestro and I originally [documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILJEYNxU28s).

Ski was originally presumed zaseth due to his extensive knowledge on phaser and development skills.
You can read the direct messages between ski's alt and I [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/937467531441102848/997581261038178304/Direct_Messages_-_Private_-_skip_979187802119995452.html).

> I've been told about you script kiddies context: i've created hacks for cpr and zaseth was not a big fan
> i know about ppl like u long before i even joined
- someone who's allegedly new to the community somehow has all this magic knowledge on me.
> and their shitty dote/electron whatever browser client makes my game run like a turd
- It's to be noted that zaseth [dislikes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937467531441102848/997589306203967550/unknown.png) dote so this set-off red flag #2.

> because im not 15
- Context: well known joke in cpps dev community I'm 13/14/15. Here's another instance of ski on a alt being aware of these [inside jokes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937467531441102848/997596297676738620/unknown.png) after claiming to have just joined the community.

Another similarity was the usage of the term "script kiddie" in our dms, a term that zaseth [loved to use](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937467531441102848/997609026466615337/unknown.png).

At first, it was just assumptions/speculations which should've been kept between only the group and some other CPPS developers, this was the case until sahmyool/floogal leaked this to the CPForever staff chat. This eventually hindered investigations on ski since he caught wind of this.

Let's go over some other solid points that further solidified this theory.

Gravix "met" ski after he applied to NewCP as speed, a convenient cover story. Here's ski's [application](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937467531441102848/997596977476939896/unknown.png), which wouldn't-ya-know it has the EXACT same skillset as someone who would've worked at CPRewritten. Here's how they ["met"](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937467531441102848/997599147215573052/unknown.png).

To my knowledge, the community isn't aware of [Scary Tales](https://twitter.com/ScaryTalesGame), a game that is being developed by the cprewritten administrator team, gravix and ski. If anyone knew how the administrators were, it'd be pretty weird to immediately trust a random that they JUST MET to work on their new game.

Here's sahmyool explaining [why](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/979207492338860122/979371023466131546/Screenshot_2022-05-26-08-30-33-810_com.discord.jpg) [[proof #2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/975764257780162581/997603644843233350/Screenshot_2022-07-16_at_1.40.35_AM.png)] zaseth should've been removed on 05/26 to kylie. This was prior to sahmyool forming a relationship/friendship with zaseth and trying to defend him. This is what I assume to be the "[start](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937467531441102848/997603202700673074/unknown.png)" of sah's friendship with zaseth since after this moment.

**BREAD AND BUTTER**

So while everything above was enough to convince me that ski was zaseth, I wanted more. That being said, here's what you clicked this post for.

These is a snippet of DMs between dirkdüêç and ski admitting he's zaseth and confirming that sahmyool was aware.

```
ski ‚Äî Today at 3:41 AM
Just wanted to let you know that the entire team including myself are most likely leaving the team because of what we learned about kylie and admitting that I'm Zaseth, etc.
We no longer want to necessarily work with her and also don't want to deal with the PR shitstorm that follows
The game isn't going to go it's your decision if you and Sam want to work with Kylie

dirk ‚Äî Today at 3:44 AM
Oh wow
What happened

ski ‚Äî Today at 3:45 AM
Basically told Sam that I was Zaseth
And that screenshot circulated and lost all trust with us
```

there you have it, zaseth, a pedophile has been in this community all this time. still associating with cpr staff on their new game and proving that both dirkd and sahmyool were aware of ski's true identity.

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**

While I'm unaware of what kylie did and what the staff team discovered about kylie, I don't really care. CPL was destined to fail from the start with a owner like Hash.
